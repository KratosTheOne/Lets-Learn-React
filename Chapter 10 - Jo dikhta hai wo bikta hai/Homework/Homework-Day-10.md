### 1. Explore all the ways of writing css.

1. Native CSS - all components's styles in a single file index.css

2. SCSS - Syntactical CSS - it is then converted to css 

3. Inline - style attribute - pass object - {{backgroundColor : "red"}}

4. Component Library - MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI

5. styled-components 

6. CSS Framework - Tailwind 

### 2. How do we configure tailwind?

<ans>Steps to use tailwind css in app : </ans>
- Install tailwind css

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
- Configure PostCSS
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}
```

- Configure your template paths

```
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
- Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 3. In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins)?

Content 

The content section is where you configure the paths to all of your HTML templates, JS components, and any other files that contain Tailwind class names.

theme 

We can customize color palette, spacing scale, typography scale, or breakpoints using theme section of your tailwind.config.js file

plugins 
The plugins section allows you to register plugins with Tailwind that can be used to generate extra utilities, components, base styles, or custom variants.
### 4. Why do we have .postcssrc file?

PostCSS is a CSS parser, framework or API that allows us to use plugins which can do various tasks. We use PostCSS because tailwind is installed as a PostCSS plugin. 

While installing tailwind, install postcss as its peer dependency. Create a '.postcssrc' file in project root, and enable the tailwindcss plugin.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}
```
